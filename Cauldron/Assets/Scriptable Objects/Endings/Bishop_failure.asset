  title: The sackcloth
  text: The bishop achieved his goal but couldn't bear the price. Together with his
    healed sister he went away to spend the rest of his life in prayer and repentance.
    Your days were numbered, but after the execution the peasants put a memorial
    of sorts at the crossroads. Didn't make it easier for your damned soul, however.
