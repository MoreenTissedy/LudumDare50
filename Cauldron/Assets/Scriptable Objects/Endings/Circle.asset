  title: The Circle
  text: It is told that the ancient serpent has devoured its own tail to represent
    the eternal cycle. It is told that no investment is more valuable than the one
    that persists through that eternity. This is why you agreed to give your life
    to The Circle for their promise of helping you in your future reincarnations.
