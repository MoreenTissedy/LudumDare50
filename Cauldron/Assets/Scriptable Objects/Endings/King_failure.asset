  title: Race for power
  text: Race for power can be dirty. There is only one winner, and no one counts
    the fallen pawns. The bishop was disgraced, and the king has no need for accomplices.
    No one came to save you. A blow of a dagger ended you path, sending you to the
    endless night, where time wraps up on itself. For a new beginning.
