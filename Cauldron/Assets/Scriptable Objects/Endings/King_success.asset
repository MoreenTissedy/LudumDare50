  title: The royal witch
  text: Shame has fallen upon the church, and for many years it will not dare interfering
    in the royal affairs. The legitimized brother of the king has become your good
    friend, and for the first time in many years, you don't have to worry about the
    coming day... Alas, no mortal protectors can save your soul, but you knew that
    all along.
