  flavourText: The old miner showed up at the mine in the morning and worked all
    day. But he kept mixing up the names of the workers from his brigade, and at
    the end of the day it turned out that he had forgotten his own. He was taken
    home to his wife and offered a week's rest. The next morning, the irrepressible
    old man came to work again, as if yesterday had never happened.
