  flavourText: "A visitor from the big city died in the village. Was it the fresh
    air or rough food that'd done him in - no one knows for sure. His brother says
    it happened in his sleep. He jokes that 'at least he ain't snoring now that he
    rests in peace' but the smile doesn't reach his eyes.\r"
