      because one can do so much more harm to his neighbor with the latter. Prized
      by our king's high steward, whose grand feasts grant vigor and good spirits
      to the esteemed monarch - why, his laughter is heard for miles around! Serve
      boiled, smashed or raw: this much is true for use in potion-making as well.\r"

      to a chosen few. 'Tis a solitary cape that stretches far into a cold sea. Yet
      somehow its meager soil bears fruit, or should we say shroom, and what fine
      specimens are those! They must be picked on the tenth day of Juno's month,
      before the tide swallows the narrow strip of land between the Nose and the
      shore. Amanitas contain dreadful powers and can make one like bird. Requires
      a gentle touch, unless one wants to end up with a face full of warts after
      drinking 'fly potion'.\r"

      use. It can heal and it can kill. Such is the dual nature of this fang. To
      unlock its healing powers one should know the secret of draining the venom,
      for the latter's main purpose is to guard the life force contained in serpent's
      bones, and the fang is where it's most potent. One needs to be careful when

      can they be used because of that. Let the fools with their heads in clouds

      made me go blind with pain! I came to my senses in the middle of a river, fully
      clothed, as if I tried to drown myself. Further experiments (on stray village
      children) proved that indeed it does cause insanity. Its leaves harbor dark

      other properties besides clouding one's senses. The juice is where its powers
      are hidden, so the plant must be kept in a deep moist cellar and the leaves
      should be picked by hand without using a blade. Else the potion will spoil,

      easily by putting some rotten grains in your cellar. With luck you can even
      discover a miraculous being, called a rat king, in which case gather only half
      of it and bury the rest in a hanged man's grave. Dry the tails and keep them
