  title: 
  flavourText: "Last night every guardsman on duty was alerted and had to report
    to Noblemen's Quarter because of rumble and shouts that were heard across the
    town. Some wierd giant bugs leveled several houses and killed about two dozens
    residents before they were surrounded and put to the sword. No one knows where
    did they come from, although the rumors are they broke loose from a walled-off
    garden where one of the lords was breeding them.\r"
