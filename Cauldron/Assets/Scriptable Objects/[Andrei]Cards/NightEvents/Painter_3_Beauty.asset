  title: 
  flavourText: Goddfridus' new masterpiece was shown on the city square. The king
    himself revealed the giant canvas. Moments later everyone in the square was crying.
    Never in their lives they saw such genuine and pure beauty. Even the thieves
    wept on their targets' shoulders, their hands halfway inside pockets and pouches.
    Goddfridus was over the moon with joy. The potion did its part, but true art
    is a magic of its own.
