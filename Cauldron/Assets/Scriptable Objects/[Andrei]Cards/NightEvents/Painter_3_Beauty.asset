  title: 
  flavourText: "Goddfridus' new masterpiece was shown on the city square. The king
    himself revealed the giant canvas. A sob here, a wet choke there, and moments
    later the everyone in the square was crying. Never in their lives they saw such
    genuine and pure beauty. Even the thieves wept on their targets' shoulders, their
    hands halfway inside pockets and pouches. Goddfridus was over the moon with joy.
    The potion did its part, but true art is a magic of its own.\r"
