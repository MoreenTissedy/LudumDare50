  title: 
  flavourText: "Goddfridus' new masterpiece was shown on the city square. The king
    himself revealed the giant canvas. The festive atmosphere was quickly shattered
    by the panic caused by the sight of the blasphemous painting. People were screaming
    and running away in fear while the brave few were throwing their belongings on
    the canvas, all just so they could avoid seeing the bizzare creatures who were
    seemingly about to enter our world through the picture. Heretical painting was
    destroyed, but the artist who tried to destroy the city escaped mob justice -
    yet not before letting slip that he had an accomplice in a pointed hat.\r"
