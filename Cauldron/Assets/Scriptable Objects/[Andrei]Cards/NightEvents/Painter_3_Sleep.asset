  title: 
  flavourText: "Goddfridus' new masterpiece was shown on the city square. The king
    himself revealed the giant canvas. Soon after the only thing heard about the
    square was loud snoring - anyone who looked directly at the painting fell asleep
    on the spot. They woke up in the evening, well-rested and with empty pockets
    - the thieves kept their eyes on the target, not some silly painting. The artist
    was absolutely livid at the reception and the painting itself was ruined by the
    rain.\r"
