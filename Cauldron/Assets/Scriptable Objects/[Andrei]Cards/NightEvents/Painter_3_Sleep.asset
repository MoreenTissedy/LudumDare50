  title: 
  flavourText: "Goddfridus' new masterpiece was shown on the city square. The king
    himself revealed the giant canvas. Soon after the loud snoring was heard \u2013
    anyone who looked directly at the painting fell asleep on the spot. They woke
    up in the evening, well-rested and with empty pockets \u2013 the thieves kept
    their eyes on the target, not some silly painting. The artist was absolutely
    livid at the reception and the painting itself was ruined by the rain."
