  flavourText: The vampire cheered up after a good laugh and then told the sad story
    of his life. How he had a friend who swore to exterminate vampires when Michael
    turned undead. How a long time ago Michael stole from the iXBT order a fragment
    of a scripture, which was the key to the mysterious grotto of the viking jarl
    Queerson. You have another such fragment. If only you could find the third part
    of the scripture, you would be able to save Michael.
