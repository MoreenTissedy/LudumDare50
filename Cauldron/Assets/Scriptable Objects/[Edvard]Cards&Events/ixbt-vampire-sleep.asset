  flavourText: "An amazing conversation took place at the Last Call Tavern last night.
    A worker swore that, while his team was dismantling a mausoleum in the older
    part of the cemetery, they found a coffin there, and in the coffin \u2014 a real
    vampire! He woke up from the noise, asked what year it was, and then cursed the
    workers dirty. They could not stand the insult and called the churchmen. Alas,
    the coffin was empty by that time. "
