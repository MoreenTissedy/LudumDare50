  title: 
  flavourText: Gustav spent all night trying to enter the tavern but the owner kicked
    him out every time. In the morning he gave an impromptu concert on the town square.
    People liked it and paid the tavern owner, and he grudgingly allowed the unfortunate
    bard to perform indoors.
