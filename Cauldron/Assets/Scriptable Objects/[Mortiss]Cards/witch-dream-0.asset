  flavourText: This dream again.<br>You're trying to wash out the stain on your mother's
    white dress. You've cut your finger and there is a red spot. But the more you
    try, the bigger gets the stain. Then you see that the water is red with blood.
    You will never be able to make the dress white again. Blood is all around you,
    on the floor, up to your ankles.<br>You wake up.
