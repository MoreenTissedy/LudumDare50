  flavourText: "The dream is there.\r<br>You are in the heather field and the earth
    shatters apart. You've been given a choice to abandon your own soul and become
    a tiger and you accepted without any doubt. As a white tiger you leap to the
    other side. With your claws you clench your love, never letting go of him. Never
    losing him again. Then you watch him turn into dust right in your paws. Dust
    falls on the shaking ground like blood flowing on a white sheet of paper, in
    stripes, sealing your fate."
