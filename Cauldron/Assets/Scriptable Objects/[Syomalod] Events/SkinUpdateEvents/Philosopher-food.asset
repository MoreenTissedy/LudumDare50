  flavourText: After filling his stomach, the philosopher suddenly realized that
    the world was too rich and generous to waste time on such a useless activity
    as work. The idea turned out to be contagious. A lot of people followed the philosopher
    and started robbing vegetable gardens, searching food in the garbage or simply
    begging. The patience of the industrious villagers quickly ran out, and the human
    locusts were driven away together with the sage.
