  flavourText: Having lost his memory, the once famous village philosopher told his
    wife that the day before he had just found the most precious truth. That knowledge
    should have turned the life of common and noble people alike into a fairy tale,
    rid the world of wars, famine, God's punishments, but... After cursing some witch,
    he began to think with renewed vigor. His frustrated wife told him to do it elsewhere
    and not to come home until he found a job.
