  flavourText: Thanks to the brave cleric, a terrible conspiracy was uncovered. A
    bunch of vile slave traders who organized the Commune of True Justice recruited
    followers only to sell them into slavery. The man of God sneaked into their abode
    unseen and unnoticed to find out their secrets, and then brought the wrath of
    the Inquisition onto the villains. For no one is allowed to fool the common people!
