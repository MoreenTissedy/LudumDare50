  flavourText: Some very special jewelry sculpted by a folk artisan is all the rage
    among the nobility and wealthy townsfolk nowadays. What does he make it out of,
    you may ask? From the most despicable material, but, thanks to his divine talent,
    even dung acquires magnificent forms that just draw the eye! And one of the ladies
    of the court recently wowed the guests with a gorgeous tiara inlaid with an unique...
    nugget.
