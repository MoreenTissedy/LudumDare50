  flavourText: The local fool suddenly became a rich man and a big spender. The things
    he bought could barely fit into his brand new cart. It is not known where the
    fool went after that, but the next morning many merchants found that their purses
    and chests are filled not with gold, but pieces of hardened dung. A hunting party
    was immediately sent after the fool, but whether they would find the swindler
    is an open question.
