  flavourText: "A rather amusing incident happened recently at the town market. A
    local fool tried to convince a seller of honey cakes that dung was gold. The
    wily merchant asked the fool to test the coins by biting to see whether they
    were real or not. Experiment ended with much spitting and cursing some \u201Cdamn
    witch\u201D."
