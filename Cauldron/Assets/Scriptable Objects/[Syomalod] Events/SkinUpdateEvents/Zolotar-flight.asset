  flavourText: '"A very unusual kind of ""rain"" hit the capital. Those who did not
    find shelter in time regretted it dearly. Royal scientists unanimously stated
    that only the evil enemies of our esteemed monarch could have caused such a mess,
    because they have neither courage nor strength for anything else. The next Sunday
    is declared by the monarch''s decree to be a day of national cleanliness, so
    the townspeople should stock up on lye and brushes."'
