  flavourText: "A long shadow falls from the throne, hiding the king's bastard brother
    marked with Leprosy, a curse of God. The king's right hand, he is rumored for
    many deeds, good and bad alike, but one is known for sure \u2013 he is the most
    clever and dangerous man at the royal court. The bishop himself regards his presence
    as a sin and a source for all misfortunes that fall upon the kingdom.\r"
