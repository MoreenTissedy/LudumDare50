  flavourText: "Big news from the capital. They say the king has called upon his
    vassals and the bishop's clergy, and before their eyes revealed an ancient chalice,
    created by the Holy Pilgrims. The king's brother has took a sip from it, and
    no signs of holy wrath befell him. This time-honored ritual was convincing enough
    for the bastard's adversaries to grudgingly acknowledge the king's brother as
    a true royal heir. The royal family have got back an important artifact, and
    you have acquired some powerful friends.\r"
