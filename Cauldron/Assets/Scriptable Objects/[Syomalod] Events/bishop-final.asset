  flavourText: Hear ye! hear ye! During the Easter service our king had an epiphany!
    He repented his sins, agreed to banish his corrupt counselors and swore an oath
    to never again raise the sword against the servants of the Lord! The realm will
    be cleansed of heresy and filth and peace and order will once again reign our
    blessed land. Let us pray for the health of our noble king and illustrious bishop!
