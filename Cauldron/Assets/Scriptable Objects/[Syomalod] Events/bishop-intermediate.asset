  flavourText: "A mysterious plague reaps a grim harvest of nobles and people close
    to the king. It seems all of them have one thing in common \u2013 a passion for
    fine cuisine, rare spices and foreign wines. The Church reminds that such delights
    are an affront to God and our traditions. Therefore, the Bishop advises every
    man, rich and poor alike, to care more for one's soul than for one's belly. The
    dead will be honored during Easter service."
