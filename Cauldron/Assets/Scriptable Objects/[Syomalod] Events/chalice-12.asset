  flavourText: Indeed, the ancient chalice should be held by a hand of iron! The
    young baroness unleashed a cruel reprisal against her cousin's supporters. She
    only took mercy on her relative, for he was just a tool in the hands of the advisor,
    whose execution is announced to be on Tuesday. You are encouraged to bring rotten
    cabbages and dried-up manure.
