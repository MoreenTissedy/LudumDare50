  flavourText: When the demon had drank enough, the chaplain dared him to turn into
    a pumpkin. The imp stood up to the challenge. And while he was impersonating
    a vegetable, the clergyman poured your potion all over him. The demon forgot

    lantern, which he now carries while on duty and shows as proof when he tells
    this story
