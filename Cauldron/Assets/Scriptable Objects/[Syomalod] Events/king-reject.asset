  flavourText: "The shadow cast by the throne isn't deep enough to swallow the church.
    Between a rock and a hard place you choose neither. Your path is your own, as
    well as the price you pay, even for refusing to choose. King\u2019s moles sowed
    heinous rumors and people\u2019s trust in you is lost forever."
