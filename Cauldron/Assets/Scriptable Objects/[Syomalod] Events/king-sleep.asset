  flavourText: "The king and his allies weren\u2019t able to discredit the bishop.
    The conspiracy was brought to light, but naturally the monarch is above suspicion.
    Both you and the messenger were made into the scapegoats because the king blamed
    you in poisoning his mind using dark magic. Inquisition\u2019s welcome will be
    very warm indeed. Well, what did you expect when you got involved into politics?\r"
