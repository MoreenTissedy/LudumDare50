  flavourText: "Thanks to you, the whole kingdom became aware of the bishop's dark
    dealings. Some condemn him, some pity him, but one thing is important for you
    and the king \u2014 the church will not dare to meddle in the royal affairs and
    impose their will upon him for a long time from now. And the Inquisition will
    be washing away the stains of corruption from the clergy and will not interfere
    in local affairs."
