  title: 
  flavourText: The whole neighborhood was abuzz with the story of a villager who
    found a cross in the ancient rocks. It looked like a relic of the Holy Ascetic,
    except it not only relieved the man from cold and hunger, but also made speak
    in tongues or giggle uncontrollably. The poor man was sent to the care of the
    local monastery, and the cross was melted down for good.
