  title: 
  flavourText: A faithful nun has found one of the most valuable and ancient relics
    in the land, the Cross of the St. Ascetic. Its power is invaluable during Lent,
    as it relieves the hunger of everyone in the neighborhood. The joyous bishop
    exempted the commoners from tithe and even ordered flour and butter to be distributed
    to the needy. It seems that holiness is returning to our gloomy lands!
