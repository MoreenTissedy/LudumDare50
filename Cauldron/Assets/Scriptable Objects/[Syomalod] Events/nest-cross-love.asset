  title: 
  flavourText: A certain villager fell madly in love with a nun. Since she had long
    ago renounced carnal passions and all worldly things, the unfortunate man thought
    of nothing better than to give her an old cross. The nun immediately recognized
    the gift as a priceless relic and handed it over to the bishop. Truly, the power
    of love works miracles!
