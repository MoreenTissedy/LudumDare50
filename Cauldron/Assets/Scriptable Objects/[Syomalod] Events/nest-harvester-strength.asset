  title: 
  flavourText: A villager who had collected a huge basket of eggs on the rocks told
    of giant nests that looked impossible to reach without wings. Strange birds,
    resembling large magpies, were scurrying around. Wonder what kind of things they
    might have brought into their nests over the years?
