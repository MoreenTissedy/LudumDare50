  flavourText: 'Local landowners, driven to desperation by the raiding brigands,
    set a bounty on the head of any low-life scum coveting his neighbor''s wealth.
    To everyone''s surprise, the Count refused to lend his support, saying that a
    head is worthless with no body to bear it.


    The heads will roll, he said,
    but probably not just the sinners''.'
