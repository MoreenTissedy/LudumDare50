  flavourText: The hermit told you a long story which you quickly lost the track
    of, but caught enough to get the gist of it. A mass unmarked grave for victims
    of some terrible crime became a source of rot and corruption. Forest hermits
    managed to calm the restless spirits by planting a bed of roses on top of it
    and watering them with sleep potions. A dubious solution, especially seeing how
    oblivion proved a much better cure.
