  flavourText: "Everyone in the city and nearby villages is plagued by nightmares.
    Shadows gather in every corner, uncertain whispers and strange scratching sounds
    are on the edge of hearing. Muffled howls from the cemeteries make blood run
    cold. Maybe the inquisition can get to the truth behind all this, who knows.
    At least the bishop\u2019s sister is alive and well. His Holiness now spends
    day and night praying, sustaining himself only on water and stale bread.\r"
